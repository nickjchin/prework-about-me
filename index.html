      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a web developer because I enjoy problem solving and being creative. When a project is complete
        I like to think back to all the challenges that I solved and then I get to enjoy the completed product.
        Also, as a child growing up with the web, I've always wanted to make websites that aligned with my interests so that I could 
        share them with people who have similar.</p>
